ANSWER_1: The course-portal service cannot read its configuration file at /etc/course-portal/portal.conf due to a Permission denied error.
ANSWER_2: The file has mode -rw------- (600), giving read/write permissions only to owner root. The course-portal account runs as group course-portal and others, both of which currently have zero permissions (---).
ANSWER_3: 640
ANSWER_3_WHY: 400 removes root write access and gives group nothing; 755 unnecessarily grants global execute access; 777 gives all users full write and execute access, creating a major security risk. 640 gives root rw- and group course-portal r-- access without over-privileging others.
ANSWER_4_ORDER: B, G, E, D, F, A, I, C, H
ANSWER_5: Any user or process on the system would gain write and execute access, allowing unauthorized modification or exploitation of the configuration file.
ANSWER_6: Checking /var/log/course-portal/app.log to confirm the Permission denied error stopped appearing and that new log entries show the application successfully starting or serving requests.
ANSWER_7_BRIDGE: component=file permissions, detect=log monitoring, recover=automated permission remediation, proof=end-to-end HTTP health checks

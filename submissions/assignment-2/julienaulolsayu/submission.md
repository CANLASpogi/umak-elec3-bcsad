## Part A. Explore

### A1. The VPC

Default VPC IPv4 CIDR:

<172.31.0.0/16>

Number of addresses in that CIDR:

<65,536>

### A2. The subnets

| Availability Zone | IPv4 CIDR |
| --- | --- |
| <ap-southeast-1a> | <172.31.32.0/20> |
| <ap-southeast-1b> | <172.31.16.0/20> |
| <ap-southeast-1c> | <172.31.0.0/20> |

Screenshot 1. Save it as `screenshot-1-subnets.png` in your folder. The image line below shows it.

### A3. Available addresses

Available IPv4 addresses in each subnet:

- <172.31.32.0/20: 4090>
- <172.31.16.0/20: 4091>
- <172.31.0.0/20: 4091>

Why is the number lower than 4,096?

<AWS reserves five IP addresses in each subnet, so only 4,091 addresses are normally available from a /20 subnet.>

What uses the missing address in the subnet with the lowest number?

<One additional IP address is currently being used by a resource in the subnet, resulting in 4,090 available addresses.>

### A4. The route table

| Destination | Target |
| --- | --- |
| <0.0.0.0/0> | <igw-0943e7e6f88293168> |
| <172.31.0.0/16> | <local> |

Screenshot 2. Save it as `screenshot-2-routes.png` in your folder. The image line below shows it.

### A5. Public or private

Are the default subnets public or private? Which route proves it?

<The default subnets are public because the route 0.0.0.0/0 points to the Internet Gateway.>

### A6. The internet gateway

State of the internet gateway:

<Attached>

What happens to the default subnets if the gateway is detached?

<The default subnets would lose their internet connectivity through the Internet Gateway.>

### A7. NAT gateways

Number of NAT gateways:

<0>

Can a server in a new private subnet download updates? Why?

<No. There is no NAT Gateway, so a server in the private subnet would not have a route that allows it to access the internet for downloading updates.>

### A8. The network ACL

| Rule number | Source | Allow or Deny |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <100> | <0.0.0.0/0> | <Allow> |
| <*> | <0.0.0.0/0> | <Deny> |

How is a network ACL different from a security group?

<A network ACL operates at the subnet level and is stateless. It supports both allow and deny rules. A security group operates at the resource level, is stateful, and only has allow rules.>

Screenshot 3. Save it as `screenshot-3-network-acl.png` in your folder. The image line below shows it.

![Screenshot 3: inbound rules of the network ACL](screenshot-3-network-acl.png)

### A9. The default security group

Inbound rule (type and source):

<All traffic — source: sg-0c5b6d4081cf0a534>

Which resources can send traffic to an instance that uses it?

<Resources associated with the same security group can send traffic to the instance.>

## Part B. Prepare

### B1. Plan two subnets

- Public subnet CIDR: <10.104.0.0/24>
- Private subnet CIDR: <10.104.1.0/24>

### B2. Route tables

Route table of the public subnet:

| Destination | Target |
| --- | --- |
| <10.104.0.0/16> | <local> |
| <0.0.0.0/0> | <Internet Gateway> |

Route table of the private subnet:

| Destination | Target |
| --- | --- |
| <10.104.0.0/16> | <local> |

### B3. My VPC diagram

Tool used (Excalidraw, draw.io, Lucidchart, or paper):

<draw.io>

Save your diagram as `vpc-diagram.png` in your folder. The image line below shows it.

![B3: my VPC diagram](vpc-diagram.png)

### B4. Predict a change

Can you still open the web page from your laptop? Why?

<No. Without the 0.0.0.0/0 route to the Internet Gateway, the instance would no longer have a route for internet traffic from the laptop.>

Can the instance still reach another instance in the VPC? Why?

<Yes. The local route 10.104.0.0/16 → local still allows communication between resources within the VPC.>

### B5. Place a database

Which subnet gets the database? Why?

<The database should be placed in the private subnet because it does not need to be directly accessible from the internet.>

### B6. My question about VPCs

What is your question, and what made you think of it?

<Why can resources in a private subnet still communicate with resources in the public subnet? This made me think about how resources in different subnets can communicate even when the private subnet does not have a route to the Internet Gateway.>

## Part A. Explore

### A1. The VPC

Default VPC IPv4 CIDR:

- 172.31.0.0/16

Number of addresses in that CIDR:

- 65,536

### A2. The subnets

| Availability Zone | IPv4 CIDR |
| --- | --- |
| ap-southeast-1a | 172.31.32.0/20 |
| ap-southeast-1b | 172.31.16.0/20 |
| ap-southeast-1c | 172.31.0.0/20 |

Screenshot 1. Save it as `screenshot-1-subnets.png` in your folder. The image line below shows it.

### A3. Available addresses

Available IPv4 addresses in each subnet:

- ap-southeast-1a: 4,090; ap-southeast-1b: 4,091; ap-southeast-1c: 4,091

Why is the number lower than 4,096?

1. AWS reserves 5 addresses in every subnet for its own use, so they cannot be assigned to instances. Since a /20 subnet has 4,096 addresses, 4,096 − 5 = 4,091 available addresses.

What uses the missing address in the subnet with the lowest number?

2. The ap-southeast-1a subnet has 4,090 available addresses, which is one less than the other subnets with 4,091. This means one additional address is already in use by a network interface, probably from an instance in that subnet.

### A4. The route table

| Destination | Target |
| --- | --- |
| 172.31.0.0/16 | local |
| 0.0.0.0/0 | igw-... |

Screenshot 2. Save it as `screenshot-2-routes.png` in your folder. The image line below shows it.

### A5. Public or private

Are the default subnets public or private? Which route proves it?

- The default subnets are public because the route 0.0.0.0/0 goes to the internet gateway.

### A6. The internet gateway

State of the internet gateway: 

- attached

What happens to the default subnets if the gateway is detached?

- If the internet gateway is detached, the 0.0.0.0/0 route can no longer provide internet access to the instance. However, an instance can still communicate with another instance in the VPC because the 172.31.0.0/16 local route remains available.

### A7. NAT gateways

Number of NAT gateways:

- 0

Can a server in a new private subnet download updates? Why?

- No, because a private subnet has no route to the internet gateway and the account has no NAT gateway. It would need a NAT gateway and a route 0.0.0.0/0 to the NAT gateway to be able to download updates.

### A8. The network ACL

| Rule number | Source | Allow or Deny |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | 0.0.0.0/0 | Allow |
| * | 0.0.0.0/0 | Deny |

How is a network ACL different from a security group?

- A security group is applied at the resource level and can only allow traffic, while a network ACL works at the subnet level and can either allow or deny traffic. Security groups are stateful, whereas network ACLs are stateless and follow the lowest-numbered rule first.

Screenshot 3. Save it as `screenshot-3-network-acl.png` in your folder. The image line below shows it.

![Screenshot 3: inbound rules of the network ACL](screenshot-3-network-acl.png)

### A9. The default security group

Inbound rule (type and source):

- All traffic and sg-...

Which resources can send traffic to an instance that uses it?

- Only resources that are associated with the same security group (sg-...) can send traffic to an instance that uses it.

## Part B. Prepare

### B1. Plan two subnets

- Public subnet CIDR: 10.190.0.0/24
- Private subnet CIDR: 10.190.1.0/24

### B2. Route tables

Route table of the public subnet:

| Destination | Target |
| --- | --- |
| 10.190.0.0/16 | local |
| 0.0.0.0/0 | internet gateway |

Route table of the private subnet:

| Destination | Target |
| --- | --- |
| 10.190.0.0/16 | local |

### B3. My VPC diagram

Tool used (Excalidraw, draw.io, Lucidchart, or paper):

- Excalidraw

Save your diagram as `vpc-diagram.png` in your folder. The image line below shows it.

### B4. Predict a change

Can you still open the web page from your laptop? Why?

- No, because the 0.0.0.0/0 route to the internet gateway was removed. The instance may still have a public IPv4 address, but it needs this route for internet traffic to reach it and return.

Can the instance still reach another instance in the VPC? Why?

- Yes. The 172.31.0.0/16 local route from A4 is still available, so traffic between instances in the same VPC can stay within the VPC instead of passing through the internet gateway.

### B5. Place a database

Which subnet gets the database? Why?

- I would place the database in the private subnet (10.190.1.0/24) because it does not have a direct route to the internet gateway. Resources within the VPC can still access the database through the VPC's internal network, while the database is not directly exposed to the internet.

### B6. My question about VPCs

What is your question, and what made you think of it?

- Question: What happens to the reply traffic when a private server sends a request through a NAT gateway, and how does the NAT gateway know which server should receive the response?

- What made me think of it: I noticed that the class account does not have a NAT gateway, so I only learned its basic purpose from the activity. This made me curious about how the return traffic is handled when multiple private servers use the same NAT gateway.
